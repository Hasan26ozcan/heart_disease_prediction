# heart_disease_prediction
I tried heart disease prediction with sigmoid and SVM models, and I found that the SVM model was more successful.

覺'm using the svm and sigmoid fucntion in neural networks and svm model it's good working
first 覺'm checking the code non-value and this data its so grade because not have any null value and 覺'm gonna check the data yes data its not have missing value but maybe have a outlier and 覺 found the outleir value colesterol and old peak you can see all fo the its picture
